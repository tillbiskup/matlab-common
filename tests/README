README for the folder "tests" of the common Toolbox for Matlab(r)

This folder contains test routines that are intended to ensure proper functionality of the different routines of the toolbox.

Per default, the directory is _not_ added by the installer routine to the Matlab(r) path, such as not to confuse the user with the testing routines not needed for normal operation.

In order to perform the tests, manually change to this folder and execute the desired tests.
